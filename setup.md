Okay to set things up.

First, download `run-rs` from `npm` then in your terminal. Open it and type `run-rs -m -k`. You must have mongoDB 4.0 and above to make it work.

Also run `npm install` to get all dependencies.

The main files that goto heroku is in the dist folder, after your work and you are sure things work well,
run `npm run build` to transpile the JS code before pushing your work.

To start your server run `npm run dev`. It'll start the server for you.

**Start your work off a different branch** make sure you checkout from the `develop`.
